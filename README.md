# Elite Tickets - A Movie Ticket Booking System

This is a software project aimed at developing a computerized ticketing system for movies to enhance the user experience, decision making and to save time. It provides a user-friendly interface for booking tickets, maintains all the information and records, and generates a report whenever required. The system aims to reduce data redundancy by using a powerful RDBMS as the backend and allows users to update or delete their records whenever required.

Due to the COVID-19 situation, certain elements of the project have been modified, such as the seat selection option not being available. The management will decide the seats to accommodate maximum social distancing based on the number of booked tickets. Also, the remaining seats depend on the number of tickets booked for a particular movie for the entire day instead of the particular showing to ensure that no seat is reused until all the theatres undergo deep cleaning at the end of the day.

## Features
* User-friendly interface for booking tickets
* Maintenance of all information and records
* Generation of reports
* Powerful RDBMS to reduce data redundancy
* User can update or delete records
* Centralized database based on client-server architecture
* Graphical analysis of various factors to enhance decision making
* COVID-19 safety measures

## Limitations and Functional Boundaries
Despite the best efforts of the developers, the following limitations and functional boundaries are evident, which limits the scope of the application software:

* There is no provision to delete old records automatically
* Updating of movies is not implemented in the project, and it requires the managers to manually update the data from the backend.

## Conclusion
The movie ticket booking system is designed to make the ticket booking process easier and convenient for the users. The system aims to provide a safe environment for moviegoers by implementing COVID-19 safety measures. Although certain limitations and functional boundaries are evident, the software provides a robust platform for ticket booking and record maintenance.

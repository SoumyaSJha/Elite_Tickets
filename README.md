# AISSCE PROJECTS

## 1. Cryptogrammer
An encryption-decryption project based in python. The program encrypts and decrypts a message to/from some commonly used ciphers - Atbash Cipher, Caesar Cipher, and A1Z26 Cipher.

## 2. Elite Tickets
A project that automates the functions of a movie ticket counter. It allows a user to book a ticket, edit it, view the booking and cancel it. It also allows the user to view the popularity of the snacks and movies and rush hour timings in the form of graphs implemented using matplotlib. The project uses MySQL as the back-end and Jupyter as the front-end.
